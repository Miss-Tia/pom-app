Peace of Mind (POM) App
Welcome to the Peace of Mind(POM) App, a Ruby on Rails web app for reflective journaling and garden tracking. Built as a final project for my Ruby on Rails course that had the best type of scope creep I've ever experienced! 
POM is a personal and purposeful space to cultivate calm.

Features
- Journaling: Write entries, edit your thoughts, and generate reflection prompts with AI.
- Garden Tracker: Organize gardens, plants, and planting events. Log progress with notes.
- Authentication: Users log in securely and access dashboards based on their role.

Tech
- Ruby on Rails 8.2
- PostgreSQL
- Turbo / Hotwire
- StimulusJS (custom controllers for prompt generation + timestamp formatting)
- RSpec + FactoryBot + Faker
- OpenAI API integration (for prompt generation)

Tests
- Request specs for all major GET, POST, PATCH routes
- Validations and model behavior tested with RSpec
- Full CRUD coverage across journal entries, plantings, and gardens.

Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pom-app.git && cd pom-app`

2. Install dependencies  
   `bundle install && yarn install`

3. Set up the database  
   `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`

4. Set your OpenAI API key  
   Create a `.env` file and add:  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

5. Run the server  
   `bin/dev` (or `rails s` if you're not using foreman)

What I Learned:
- How to build and test full CRUD Rails resources
- Implementing user authentication and role-based access
- Integrating external APIs using POST requests and Stimulus
- Building a custom UI that reflects an app‚Äôs emotional tone
- Debugging complex controller/view logic in a real-world project

Future Plans for POM:
- Add image upload and file attachments to journal entries
- Calendar view for planting and watering schedules
- More nuanced AI prompt generation (e.g. mood-based prompts)
- Recipe keeper that can be tied to a journal entry
- Image upload for Recipe keeper
